# Conductor.js

Conductor.js is a library, built on top of [Oasis.js](1), for embedding
untrusted rich content that can still participate in a larger ecosystem.
It defines both a standard set of Oasis.js services and events, as well
as an implementation that makes consuming these services more pleasant.
